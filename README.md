# Firehose-Processing
Code for processing BlueSky's firehose

## Project has been discontinued
I've gotten more disappointed with the actions and enforcement of the TOS, and I no longer can support BlueSky. With the prospect of federation on the horizon, I believe it's going to be a disaster, and it's not something I want to be a part of either. Some of the most vile people I've seen are allowed to operate day to day terror campaigns against anyone they feel like, often times just for existing. Similar to Twitter(X)'s lack of enforcement, it's now also the case. I no longer believe this is a safe platform for any minority of the population, or even the majority. I did have some bit of hope it would turn around, and it hasn't. I do not believe it's going to.

I think the point at where I saw a social group, who is infamous for this on Twitter/X, encouraging trans individuals to go drink bleach and equating being trans as being a part of the KKK, celebrating getting away with it, was probably my final straw in many of the stuff I've seen. I left twitter a year ago, and I have no interest in helping support another place that is essentially an off brand Twitter, with the same dehumanizing sociopathic behaviors, with no moderation actions.
